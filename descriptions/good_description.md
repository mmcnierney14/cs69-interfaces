#### We care about security
Here at _FriendApp_, we care very much about our users' security. That's why we have a couple of rules regarding the passwords you choose.

 * Your password must include at least one symbol
 * Your password must include at least one number
 * Your password must be at least 8 characters long
 * You must be able to remember your password without having to write it down!

#### Why so many rules?
We've instated these password requirements as a result of careful research into password security. Requiring that passwords must include numbers and symbols and be at least 8 characters increases the complexity of the password and makes it harder for an attacker to guess. These are standard practice in the security industry. Read more about these measures in [this great blog post](http://www.thegeekstuff.com/2008/06/the-ultimate-guide-for-creating-strong-passwords/).
